  "description": "Algarrobo has a unique history. Though it was a port of call for pirate corsairs during the 16th century, the town was not built up until the mid-1800s. Vestiges of this era include Candelaria Chapel which was built in 1837 and Isla Pájaro Niño Nature Sanctuary, home to ancient fossils and ecosystems which welcome migratory birds each summer.\r\nDue to its consistent wind conditions and wide open shore, has been stablished as the Nautique Capital along the whole country, and became the principal sailing race spot.",
