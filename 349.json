  "title": "The Dune Sea of Ganges Chasma",
  "description": "This image is at the eastern edge of a very large deposit of wind-blown dust that occupies Ganges Chasma.\r\nThis thick deposit surrounds hills and mesas that rise up through it. We can tell from the patterns that the wind here is primarily blowing from east to west. There is a large cone-shaped hill whose eastern toe is surrounded by a dune crest, but its western toe and a lane that stretches off the image frame is clear of this dust deposit.",
