  "description": "El Tatio is a geyser field located within the Andes Mountains of northern Chile at 4,320 meters above mean sea level. Its name comes from the Quechua word for oven. It is among the highest-elevation geyser fields in the world. El Tatio has over 80 active geysers, making it the largest geyser field in the southern hemisphere and the third largest in the world. The site receives over 100,000 visitors per year, and is the principal attraction of nearby San Pedro de Atacama; whose mayor condemned the ecological impact of the operation and stressed that the geysers are in an indigenous zone that \"our people put value on and (our people) show to the world\".",
