  "description": "The night sides of Saturn and Tethys are dark places indeed.\r\nWe know that shadows are darker areas than sunlit areas, and in space, with no air to scatter the light, shadows can appear almost totally black.\r\nTethys (660 miles or 1,062 kilometers across) is just barely seen in the lower left quadrant of this image below the ring plane and has been brightened by a factor of three to increase its visibility.\r\nThe wavy outline of Saturn's polar hexagon is visible at top center.",
