  "description": "The 50-km-diameter circular Richat structure is one of those geological features that are more clearly observed from space than from down on the ground, with this 'eye of Africa' a familiar landmark to astronauts since the earliest manned missions.\r\n\r\nOnce thought to be the result of a meteor impact, today researchers believe the Richat structure was caused by process of geological uplift followed by erosion from wind and water.",
