  "title": "Vatnajökull, Iceland",
  "description": "In southeastern Iceland lies the largest glacier in all of Europe: Vatnajökull. In places 400 meters (1,312 feet) thick, the massive glacier covers 8 percent of the entire country. Capping several active volcanoes, Vatnajökull is subject to glacial melt floods when volcanic heat melts portions of the bottom side of the glacier. The water eventually rises above the level of the caldera and spills downward under the pull of gravity.",
