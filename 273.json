  "description": "The tongue of the Malaspina Glacier, the one of the largest glaciers in Alaska, fills most of this image. The Malaspina lies west of Yakutat Bay and covers roughly 1,500 sq mi (3,880 sq km). This is a false-color composite image made using infrared, near infrared, and green wavelengths. The image has also been sharpened using the sensor's panchromatic band.",
