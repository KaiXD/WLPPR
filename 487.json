  "description": "The image shows the same area in a composite image composed from MISR’s backward-, vertical-, and forward-pointing cameras. By combining these different angles in one image, you can discern surface roughness. Rougher surfaces appear pink and smoother areas appear purple. The ice shelf is generally smoother than the sea ice, with the exception of the crack—an indication that it is actively growing, according to the MISR team. Project MIDAS, a group in the United Kingdom that has been tracking the rift, reported that the crack grew 22 kilometers (13 miles) over the past six months. It now stretches 130 kilometers (80 miles).",
