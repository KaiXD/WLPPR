  "title": "Khurdopin Glacier",
  "description": "Khurdopin has a prominent band of debris (a medial moraine) that runs down its center. The moraine winds and loops in a distinctive way that suggests the glacier “surges” every few decades. Surging glaciers cycle through quiet periods, in which they store large amounts of ice and snow at high elevation, and then periods of rapid forward movement.",
