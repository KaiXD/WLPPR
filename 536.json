  "description": "A crescent Saturn appears nestled within encircling rings in this Cassini spacecraft image.\r\n\r\nClouds swirl through the atmosphere of the planet. Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) orbits between the main rings and the thin F ring, and this moon appears as a speck above the rings near the middle of the image.\r\n\r\nThis view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from about 3 degrees below the ringplane.",
