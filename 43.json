A symmetrical stratovolcano stands in its center, rising 1,280 meters (4,200 feet) above the North Pacific Ocean; the entire island is just 10 kilometers (6 miles) across. Herbert (Chiĝulax in the Aleut language) sits within a few tens of kilometers of three other volcanoes: Carlisle, Cleveland, and Tana.",
