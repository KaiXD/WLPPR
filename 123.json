  "title": "Banded Bedrock in Terra Sabaea",
  "description": "Terra Sabaea is the region of ancient highlands north of the Hellas impact basin. \r\n\r\nThe enhanced color image shows bands of bedrock with different colors. Such colorful bedrock is typical of ancient Mars, when water played a more active role in altering minerals, and multiple geologic processes were very active (impact, volcanism, fluvial, tectonic).",
