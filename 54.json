  "description": "This range of inactive – with some potentially active – volcanoes in the central Sahara desert covers about 100 000 sq km. Home to the Toubou people today, the region is known for its ancient cave paintings, mostly dating from the fifth to the third millennium BC.\r\n\r\nThe isolated area with little vegetation is known as the 'mountains of hunger' because they can feed few people. Some plant life does exist, supporting populations of gazelle, Barbary sheep and cheetah.",
