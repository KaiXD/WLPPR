  "description": "NASA's New Horizons captured this high-resolution enhanced color view (check out original resources) of Charon just before closest approach on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images, the colors are processed to best highlight the variation of surface properties across Charon. Charon's color palette is not as diverse as Pluto's; most striking is the reddish north (top) polar region, informally named Mordor Macula.",
