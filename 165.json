  "title": "A Fresh Crater near Sirenum Fossae",
  "description": "This impact crater appears relatively recent as it has a sharp rim and well-preserved ejecta. \r\n\r\nThe steep inner slopes are carved by gullies and include possible recurring slope lineae on the equator-facing slopes. Fresh craters often have steep, active slopes, so we are monitoring this crater for changes over time. \r\n",
