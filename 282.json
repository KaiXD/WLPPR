  "title": "Layers and Fractures in Ophir Chasma",
  "description": "Ophir Chasma forms the northern portion of Valles Marineris, and this image features a small part of its wall and floor.\r\n\r\nThe wall rock shows many sedimentary layers and the floor is covered with wind-blown ridges, which are intermediate in size between sand ripples and sand dunes. Rocks protruding on the floor could be volcanic intrusions of once-molten magma that have pushed aside the surrounding sedimentary layers and \"froze\" in place.",
