  "description": "National parks protect forested areas from human activities that cause land degradation and deforestation. The boundary between protected and non-protected areas is often very clear in satellite images – as we see here between the green, densely forested area and surrounding agricultural landscape.\r\n\r\nThe land here was first formally protected in 1881, within a 9.6 km radius of the mountain summit.",
