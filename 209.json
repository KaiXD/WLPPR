  "title": "Cratered Summit of a Knob",
  "description": "There are many knob formations is the southeastern Acidalia region of Mars. All show a hilltop crest except one which has a summit crater that resembles a cone volcano.\r\n\r\nKnobs like these likely formed from interactions between water ice and lava. For instance, the crater at the top of the center knob is likely from a steam explosion when lava vaporized ice. As such, this summit crater is not an impact crater.",
