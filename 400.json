  "description": "The Atacama Desert may be the oldest desert on earth, and has experienced extreme hyperaridity for at least 3 million years, making it the oldest continuously arid region on earth. The soil has been compared to that of Mars. Owing to its otherworldly appearance, the Atacama has been used as a location for filming Mars scenes. \r\nAlso, because of its high altitude, nearly non-existent cloud cover, dry air, and lack of light pollution and radio interference from widely populated cities and town, this desert is one of the best places in the world to conduct astronomical observations.The European Southern Observatory operates two major observatories in the Atacama: The La Silla Observatory & The Paranal Observatory, which includes the Very Large Telescope.",
