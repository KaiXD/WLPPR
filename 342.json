  "title": "Golden Gate Bridge",
  "description": "Spanning the narrow mouth of the San Francisco Bay, the bridge connects the Presidio of San Francisco in the south to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, near the town of Sausalito, in the north. The bridge’s characteristic bright orange finish stands out against the dark water below, as the occasional boat leaves a white wave trail in the San Francisco Bay. Although it enables thousands of commuters to cross the bay, the bridge is not the only means of reaching the city; commuters also rely in ferryboats.",
