  "title": "Linear Gullies Inside Russell Crater",
  "description": "Several types of downhill flow features have been observed on Mars. This image is an example of a type called \"linear gullies.\" Linear gullies are characterized by relatively constant width and by raised banks or levees along the sides. Unlike gullies caused by water-lubricated flows on Earth and possibly on Mars, they don't have aprons of debris at the downhill end of the channel. The grooves shown here, on the side of a large sand dune inside Russell Crater, are the longest linear gullies known, extending almost 1.2 miles (2 kilometers) down this dune slope.",
